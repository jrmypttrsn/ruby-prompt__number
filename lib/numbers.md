# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

There are two types of numbers: integers and floats.

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

Common operations include '+', '-', '*', and '/'. Comparisons include '==', '!=', '<', '>', '>=', '<=", and '<=>'.

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

When used with a number '+' acts as a mathematical operation, addition. '+' is used to combine more than one string together.

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

If you multiplied "20" by 2 it would return the string twice ("2020"). To perform a mathematical operation you would have to remove the quotation marks and then perform the operation.

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

The 'times' operation is used to repeat an instruction a set number of times. '*' is used to multiply numbers.
